# Tumor-Data-Set
I'm using  the Breast Cancer Wisconsin data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model was used to reduce the dataset's dimensions while preserving essential information (more that 95% of original data variation), and then visualizing 2D and 3D plots of the new reduced-dimensional data.
Decision Tree and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) models were employed to classify tumor types between Malignant (M) and Benign (B) classes based on the reduced-dimensional data.
